      <h2> Designing the World Wide Web </h2>
      <p> Shortly after graduating college Mr. Berners-Lee started working as an
        engineer for a telecommunications company called Plessy. There, he would
        develop typesetting software for printers. This would set up his career
        becoming familiar with hypertext (a piece of text that is linked to
        another document that gives the user immediate access to specific
        information.)</p>
      <p> His curiosity for the expansion of hypertext led to him creating a
        prototype system called "ENQUIRE." This program was similar to others
        (Apple's HyperCard, Memex, NLS, etc), but was able to run on many
        different systems and was portable. However, it lacked image rendering.
        ENQUIRE worked by linking various documents, or cards, together where
        users could simply click the link and open the "new page." Anyone with
        access to the program was able to add or remove cards. It worked mostly
        like a wiki then a series of web pages. It was a database for anyone who
        had access. Eventually this program would be fleshed out and the World
        Wide Web would be born. </p>
      <p> Tim Berners-Lee came back to work at CERN in 1984 and used his ENQUIRE
        system daily. He found where the program was lacking. He needed to
        create a system where most of the time spent was keeping information up
        to date, but to allow anyone to update information. He wanted to create
        this same type of system, but accessible to everyone. He needed a
        program where users were able to link new cards without having to update
        old ones, or create new cards independent of others. He also wanted to
        add a feature where you could link to separate databases and a system
        able to handle a lot of user traffic. In 1989, CERN was considered the
        "largest internet node" in Europe. Berners-Lee saw this as an
        opportunity to combine his hyperlink text database with the Internet. </p>
      <p> Here are two quotes from Tim Berners-Lee regarding the creation of the
        World Wide Web.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <blockquote> "I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to
            the TCP and DNS ideas and—ta-da!—the World Wide Web." — Tim
            Berners-Lee </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <blockquote> "Creating the web was really an act of desperation,
            because the situation without it was very difficult when I was
            working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web,
            like the hypertext, like the Internet, multifont text objects, had
            all been designed already. I just had to put them together. It was a
            step of generalizing, going to a higher level of abstraction,
            thinking about all the documentation systems out there as being
            possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system." — Tim
            Berners-Lee</blockquote>

      <p>His efforts is the reason why you can click an image of a dog on google
        that takes you to a website that allows you to search for foster puppies
        in your area. It's the way we navigate the internet today. It's how this
        website has 4 clickable links at the top that take you to other web
        pages. Berners-Lee did all this as a way to help humanity. He created
        this as an open source program so as many people as possible could use
        it and create with it. His motivations were to help people share
        information, not for money or fame. In my opinion, this is the original
        roots of why the internet was so cool. With advertising agencies, social
        media companies, and large corporations, we're starting to lose the
        uniqueness of being able to share information freely and openly.
        Everything now-a-days has a paywall, or you need to enter personal
        information to create an account, everything you click is monitored and
        recorded and eventually used by some company to make money. Today, the
        internet feels more like a human farming tool than a free place to share
        information. This takes us further away from what the web was designed
        to do and the vision that Tim Berners-Lee had.</p>
