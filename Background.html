      <h2>Background and History</h2>
      <p>Tim Berners-Lee was born July 8th, 1955 in London. He was the eldest of
        4 and both of his parents were computer scientist. He grew up as a train
        enthusiast and learned about electronics while tinkering with model
        trains. After attending primary school at Sheen Mount Primary School, he
        went on to attend south-west London's Emmanuel School. He would later
        attend The Queen's College, Oxford from 1973 - 1976 where he built his
        first computer out of an old broken TV set.</p>
      <p>
        From there, he would work for CERN in the UK and begin his career in computer science.
